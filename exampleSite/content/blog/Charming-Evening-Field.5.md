_Nepal is a magical country and one of the few places in the world–Ashlan Gorse Cousteau._

Nepal is one of the unique places on the planet. Of course, it is a spiritual place. Filled with temples and monasteries, and the birthplace of Buddah to boot. It is mostly unspoiled by tourism, which makes it perfect for exploring and seeking some peace. So if you are ready to go somewhere that is lush and has a fantastic culture, then look no further–Nepal is perfect for you. Let’s look at just a few reasons. If you haven’t heard of Nepal before, look at [where is Nepal](https://www.jucktion.com/where-is-nepal) first.

## Cheap

If you want to have an adventure without emptying your bank account, then Nepal is going to be perfect for you. A great example is that you can have fresh food in Kathmandu for 400 rupees… which works out to about £3. And if you head off the beaten track, then you can have unlimited Daal Bhat for 250 rupees.

You can also swap hotels and hostels with ease, as there are enough hotels, hostels or home stays.

## Scenery

Of course, you want to have the best views of the snow-capped mountains. So, [when is the best time of the year to visit Nepal](https://www.encounterstravel.com/uk/destination/nepal)?

Ideally, the best time is between October and November. This will give you the highest amount of sun if you want it a little cooler, then March and May are great for spring weather.

There are a vast range of landscapes to see in Nepal. You will find jungles, paddy fields and the world’s highest mountains too. While it is landlocked, that doesn’t mean you will be missing a variety.

## Hiking

One of the most common reasons to head to Nepal is because you want to hike. There is a range of options. You should book an excursion with a professional company, though, as navigating on your own can be exhausting. But solo-traveling can be an exciting experience. You can hike to stunning heights if that is what you want to do. Or alternative if you want to see the Himalayas, then you should head to the [Annapurna Conservation Area](Annapurna Conservation Area), which is located north of Pokhara.

There are many routes that are designed for the average traveler too, so don’t be put-off by your fitness levels. There’s something for everyone.

## Easy

Because of the location, you can head to a range of other places from Nepal when you have finished exploring. You can travel to India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and China with ease. And you can find some really cheap flights to South-East Asian and Sri Lanka too.

## Food

Nepal has an exciting cuisine. Something you will probably eat a lot of is momos. They are a snack of vegetables or meat, wrapped in a delicious dough. You will find them fried or steamed. Request the one you prefer before ordering. The other dish is [Dhal Bhat](https://www.196flavors.com/nepal-dal-bhat/), which is rice, vegetables and curried lentils. You can get it with meat too, which is just slightly more expensive.
