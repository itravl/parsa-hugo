Vietnam is in the eastern region of Asia and has a population of around 100 million. It was once part of French Indochina until the civil war divided it into two countries in 1954. The northern region became North Vietnam, while the southern territory became South Vietnam. A communist government ruled North Vietnam, which was involved in the Vietnam War from 1965 to 1975. The country is now a socialist republic, and its economy depends on agriculture and manufacturing. North Vietnam’s main exports are rice, coffee, and rubber. The country has several natural and cultural attractions, including the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Halong Bay, the limestone mountain regions of Northern Vietnam, and the bustling capital city of Hanoi.

Vietnam is a stunning country in the heart of Southeast Asia. It is an amazing destination with many beautiful landscapes, lush rainforests, and gorgeous beaches.

From the breathtaking nature to the rich cultural heritage, Central Vietnam has something for everyone.

## Best time to visit?

### Northern Vietnam

Visiting the north of Vietnam is most pleasant between September and December when the humidity is not too high. However, come January; the weather turns cold and wet until March. The rain can be overwhelming from May to September, leading to flooding.

The northern region of Vietnam experiences a chilly and moist climate in the winter months from November to April, with the city of Hanoi having temperatures that usually hover around 15°C. From May to October, it is hot and dry.

Visiting in the spring or fall is the ideal time to explore the Highlands. Winter temperatures can dip below freezing, and snow is possible. In contrast, summer temperatures can soar to over 40 degrees Celsius. The best time to visit is between March and November to avoid the risk of typhoons.

### Central Vietnam

The Central region of Vietnam has a climate between the north and south weather patterns. A rainy season usually occurs during the summer months. The coastal parts of the Central region are usually dry from May to October but wetter from December to February. Highland areas can become cold in winter, and typhoons can strike between July and November.

Visiting the Central Highlands during the dry and cool months of December through March is a great time for a vacation. Late November, when we saw it, was a great time to be there, with warm days and comfortable evenings, with only a few light showers as we traveled to Hoi An. The central coast experiences a rainy season from December to February, while June to October is usually quite dry and hot.

Go when convenient for you, as long as it is a safe and responsible time. Consider the weather, your energy level, the availability of transportation, and other factors.

### South Vietnam

The South of Vietnam features a tropical climate with high temperatures and humidity, making touring Ho Chi Minh City particularly tiring during much of the year. Rainfall peaks between June and August, while December to April is typically very dry. The average temperature usually falls between 25-30°C, and the most uncomfortable conditions naturally occur from the end of February to May.

December to April is the ideal time to travel to southern Vietnam. Despite the wet season (May to November) having some light showers, it is still safe to visit during these months. However, if you spot dark clouds, consider having lunch indoors. However, the Mekong Delta can sometimes can flood during this season, making it hard to access.

No matter the time of year, there is always something to discover in Vietnam. The country geographically has three distinct regions—Northern, Central, and Southern. Each has its climate and, therefore, a different time of year that may be ideal for visiting. Therefore, there is no definitive “best” or “worst” time to visit Vietnam; it all depends on what part of the country you’d like to explore.

## Weather

Jan and Feb are the prime months to travel to Vietnam’s northern and coastal regions because of the pleasant climate they offer. It is one of the best times of the year to make a trip. These three months signify the beginning of spring.

March and April are great times to travel, as they are usually less crowded than other months, and the weather is dry. However, it’s likely to rain more often in May, though not all day. Phu Quoc Island is a nice destination from March to September, but it can rain throughout the day in September. If you’re looking for a dryer time to visit, March is a great option as it is one of the least rainy months of the year, although you may experience brief showers in Hue and Hoi An.

June-Aug is the summer months when the temperature is very high in many northern and central cities. During this period, it’s the rainy season in Ho Chi Minh City, the central highlands (and Phu Quoc in the south), and the hottest season in Hanoi.

The last two months of the year, November and December, bring the onset of winter and the joy of the holiday season. These months are filled with festive celebrations, family gatherings, and cozy nights by the fire. From Thanksgiving to Christmas and New Year’s, these special times of the year are a reminder of the importance of togetherness and the joy of being surrounded by loved ones.

Visiting Vietnam in November and December is ideal as the weather in northern Vietnam is mild, with temperatures in Hanoi ranging from 15-25°C and 10-20°C in Sapa. The temperatures drop during January and February, making it the coldest period. The central and southern regions of the country are pleasant, barring any typhoons. My November experience was pleasant because of the comfortable temperature and low humidity.

The weather in South Vietnam is pleasant and humid. There is no rain, only occasional dry thunderstorms in the evenings, providing a nice backdrop over the Mekong. The temperature is warm but not too hot.

## Clothing

It is prudent to wear lighter, more airy clothing in bright hues for most of the year. For trips to the northern regions during December and January, it is better to don warmer and more insulated garments.

In Vietnam, it is wise to be prepared for rain from May through November in the southern and northern regions and from August to January in the central area. Bringing umbrellas or raincoats is recommended to stay dry.

In Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, wearing suits for business meetings is customary. Maintain a respectful atmosphere; it is advisable to dress appropriately when visiting religious places like temples and pagodas.

## **Protection**

When visiting a large city, leaving valuable items at home is best. Avoid giving money to panhandlers and not purchasing things from street vendors. Bringing unnecessary items or giving money to those begging for it is superfluous.

We recommend exchanging currencies with a bank or a legitimate currency exchange office. Do not trade money in any non-official location. Avoid taking a pedicab or “honda-om” alone.

## **Language**

Hotel staff can communicate in English, French, Cantonese, and Japanese. Guides and interpreters are available to help visitors who speak any of these languages and additional languages such as Russian, German, Mandarin, and more.

## Food

Vietnamese food is becoming more and more popular in the United States. And it’s no wonder why! Vietnamese cuisine is flavorful, healthy, and relatively inexpensive. Plus, there are many delicious options to choose from to your heart’s content.

If you’re new to Vietnamese food, a good place to start is with pho. Pho is a rice noodle soup typically made with beef or chicken. The Vietnamese serve it with various toppings, such as bean sprouts, cilantro, and lime.

Banh mi is another popular Vietnamese dish. Banh mi is a sandwich with a crusty baguette filled with meats, pickled vegetables, and fresh herbs.

Other popular Vietnamese dishes include spring rolls, summer rolls, and bahn xeo. Spring rolls contain pork, shrimp, vegetables, and a dipping sauce. Summer rolls are like spring rolls but without frying. Bahn xeo is a savory pancake made with shrimp, pork, and bean sprouts.

Vietnamese food is a great option if you’re looking for a delicious, healthy, and inexpensive meal!
